                <article class = "review">

                    <center><img src="img/atl/laptopsleeve/sleeve1.jpg" class="resizer"/></center>
                    <p>So a couple weeks back my sister decided to splurge and get a MacBook Pro Retina 13” (a choice I support, by the way.) and had to buy all sorts of accessories to go along with it.</p>
                    <img src="img/atl/laptopsleeve/sleeve2.jpg" class = "resizer" align="right" />
                    <p>We headed on over to Hauz Khas Village here in New Delhi (but of course you know!) and she decided on checking the Chumbak shop for something cool, fun and nice to look at and came out with a laptop sleeve that cost her (and I forgot), around 1500 Rs, I guess, which in my opinion is a bit much to be spending on a laptop sleeve, especially when you’re just gonna drop that inside a laptop bag and carry it from there, a 300 Rs sleeve from a local shop would work just as fine. So I decided, finally, that I should see what’s so special about this particular product from Chumbak.</p>
                    <img src="img/atl/laptopsleeve/sleeve3.jpg" align="left" class = "resizer left-aligned"/>
                    <p>From the outside (and at a distance), the sleeve looks like just another laptop sleeve, with blue and yellow colour combinations (that I don't really approve of) and random stuff like “Wild Kranti Vodka” and “Gung Ho Gin” written all over it. Closer, however, the sleeve does impress a fair bit.
                    </p>
                    <p>The material used is good, and the yellow part is leather, which is awesome, though unnecessary in some ways. The zippers are of a great quality and are fitted with leather bits to grip and pull the zip open and close, which I like, because it feels soft and comfortable to hold. Chumbak put two pockets in the sleeve, one for your laptop (duh!) and another for any number of small useless (or useful, you know…) items that you probably have no other place for. I'd usually put my pen drives, external HD etc along with my phone charging cable.</p>
                    <img src="img/atl/laptopsleeve/sleeve4.jpg" align="right" class = "resizer" />
                    <p>However, small as the second pocket is, you cannot put a laptop charger inside it, without quietly worrying about the safety of your laptop screen, because it exerts just way too much pressure on it.</p>
                    <p>The inside of the sleeve is not too soft and doesn’t really make me feel all that comfortable with the idea of keeping my laptop inside it, although it hasn’t scratched it or anything, so maybe that’s just me being paranoid.</p>
                    <p>The sleeve in itself looks (and is!) much larger than the 13” laptop it was bought for and hence it’s impossible to slide it inside my laptop bag (which, yeah, is for a 13” laptop). So it’s basically useless for me unless I just need to carry my laptop somewhere or I buy a bigger laptop bag. The former is a condition that has happened a fair number of times, and I’ve been thankful to the Chumbak laptop sleeve then.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise, I prefer the cheap 300 Rs laptop sleeve that I have. It’s zipper free, reversible, and soft, which makes me feel a lot more comfortable sliding my laptop inside it, although it probably gives less protection than the Chumbak sleeve does, but hey, I carry it inside a laptop bag, it’s got enough protection as it is.</p>
