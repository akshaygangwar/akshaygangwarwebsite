                    <p>I’m sure I’m not the only one with battery woes. I use my phone a LOT, more than what the average person does and it being a 5” screen with a battery that has only 2100 mAh of charge in it, gets discharged at an alarming rate.</p>
                    <p>Yeah, I use Google Now (location reporting turned on.), my 3G is always on and I create a lot of hotspots using my phone (sometimes to share internet to my laptop, sometimes to just play a game of counter-strike on LAN with my friends. Yes, you can use a phone wifi hotspot to play on LAN, WITHOUT any internet connection.)</p>
                    <p>Anyway, my phone usually goes from 100% at 7 AM to less than 20% by the time I get back home around 6 PM, and that is if I stop using it too much sometime around 3 PM.
                    </p>
                    <p>When Xiaomi came out with their 10400 mAh and 5200 mAh power banks, I was excited due to the lot of positive reviews they were getting.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, for me, the 10400 mAh option I wanted to go for went out of stock at such a speed that I had to settle for the 5200 mAh one, which was fine considering my phone has a 2100 mAh battery, so this would do the trick.</p>

                    <p>The power bank looks great. It’s an aluminium casing with plastic covers on both ends, and I’m not talking cheap plastic. This is good quality, sturdy plastic that feels classy and goes well with the silver colour of the unit.</p>
                    <p>Ever since I first got an iPod Touch, I’ve been a fan of devices with metal bodies. The power bank looks cool, and goes perfectly in the same bag as my MacBook Air (and looks a lot like a well designed unit, much like the Air.)</p>
                    <p>It feels strong, though I don’t think you’d want to drop it onto hard floors and such.</a>

                    <p>Well, I say “buttons”, but there’s really just one. A round button on the top (well, I say “top”), of the power bank that, when pressed, gives an indication of the amount of charge remaining in the power bank.</p>
                    <p>There are two ports, a standard USB port and a micro-USB port for charging the power bank and charging a device from the power bank, respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>Xiaomi gives a small, greyish USB to micro-USB cable along with the power bank, which is handy for travelling, but won’t serve well if you’re charging the power bank from a wall socket. </p>
                    <p>I myself have a multi-USB hub that I use for charging all my devices, so this cable works fine for me, but it’s not a problem if you don’t use USB hubs, because, being a micro-USB port, it can pretty much be charged using any micro-USB cable you have lying around.</p>

                    <p>There are four small LEDs on the top of the power bank that light up to show the amount of charge remaining in the power bank, each of the LED corresponding to 25%.</p>
                    <p>These are helpful, duh, and can give you an easy estimate as to how much you will be able to squeeze out of the power bank.</p>

                <article class = "review">
                    <p>At a price point of 699 Rs, the Xiaomi 5200 mAh Power Bank works wonders, however, if you can get your hands on the 10400 mAh option, go for THAT. It will squeeze a lot more into your phone and at 999 Rs costs only marginally more for double the charge capacity.</p>
                    <p>Regardless, the 5200 mAh option works for me, it easily charges my phone 2 times over, which is more than what I usually need, unless I’m travelling on long train journeys, of-course.</p>
