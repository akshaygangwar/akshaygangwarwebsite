                    <p>“We are the new americana, high on legal marijuana”, Halsey’s New Americana is playing on as I sit to write this review. This has been one review that I have been wanting to write for quite some time, but I wanted to really use the earphones before coming to any conclusions about them.</p>

                    <p>Out of the box, the QY7 come in a hard-shell case with the SoundPEATS logo and name printed on it. It’s really impressive — the case; and is also probably the only thing that looks and feels premium about these earphones.</p>
                    <img src="img/atl/soundpeats/soundpeats2.jpg" class="resizer" align="right" />
                    <p>Now don’t get me wrong, the earphones are not of poor build quality, in fact, they are pretty decent. They aren’t however anything more. The buttons on the right side for volume adjustment, pairing and power feel poorly constructed, especially the pairing (plus power) button. The body of the earphones is made of a shiny plastic which doesn’t look nearly classy enough and is also a fingerprint magnet.</p>
                    <p>On the left side, there is a micro USB port for charging; opening the cover of this port feels very clumsy and makes me worry that I might accidentally break off the rubber cover completely. SoundPEATS provide a short USB cable in the box for charging purposes, however it was a very tight fit into the port which I felt might actually damage it. I prefer using a different cable for charging, just to be safe.</a></p>
                    <p>The wire connecting the left side to the right looks decent, isn’t very hard and generally does not interfere with listening to music, plus they provide a tension-clip and a cable clip to fix the cable to your shirt, in case you’re running.

                    <p>TOne thing I liked about these earphones is the battery life they give. Now, I was skeptical of a 5 hour battery life on these, but they live up to it and then some. I took a trip to Lucknow, back in February; a journey that took me almost 12 hours (thanks to the really, really late train) and I listened to music for around 7-8 hours there, and kept the earphones on standby for the rest of the journey and they didn’t disappoint.</p>

                    <p>Lights on an earphone probably don’t need a separate section, but I am so disappointed with the way these earphones light up that I needed the space to rant.</p>
                    <p>When you first power on the earphones, there’s a light under the power button that lights up (blue). Keep the power button pressed and the earphones go into pairing mode. This is where I believe they could’ve done something better with the lights. As soon as the earphones go into pairing mode, the light alternates very quickly between blue and red and believe me it looks like a cheap poor quality product while it does that. They could’ve gone with a fast blinking blue light, too, and I personally would have preferred that.</p>

                    <p>Sound quality is undoubtedly the most important aspect of a pair of earphones, and this is why I’m not complaining about the SoundPEATS QY7. They have a great sound quality, and a pretty “bass-y” sound. “Bass-y” not in a bad way. I love the sound on these, and while I may not be an audiophile, I definitely am passionate when it comes to listening to music.</p>
                    <p>I was using AudioTechnica Headphones before these and their sound quality was undoubtedly better, but not by a lot.</p>
                    <p>For a pair of bluetooth earphones (that can connect to two devices at once, by the way), at Rs 1900, the sound quality is actually more than what I would expect. Even at higher volumes; *especially* at higher volumes. These earphones don’t disappoint.</p>

                <article class="review">
                    <p>I would definitely recommend the QY7 to anyone looking for a bluetooth earphones that are not too heavy on the pocket. The sound quality is great and the build is not that bad, not at all bad for Rs 1900.</p>
