<h1>Death Star Log 2 | 24 July 2016</h1>

<p>.... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. .-.-.-</p>

<p>Don’t get used to daily posts from me, I mean, I know you like reading them, but I don’t have the time to write here, everyday.</p>

<p>If you would like to read more stuff from me, feel free to check out <a href="http://beebom.com">Beebom</a>, which is the company I write at. My articles over there are a lot like my blog posts here, in that, they are also fun to read. My articles over there are a lot different than my blog posts on Death Star Logs, in that, they are informative, while these Death Star Logs are… you know.</p>

<h1>IT’S A SUNDAY!</h1>

<p>And there’s no sun… I’m not even complaining. I like the fact that after an entire week of a heatwave that would melt even the frozen carbonite that was used on Han Solo, we finally have some <em>no-sun</em> time. It’s fun! <em>Since</em> it’s Sunday, I finally got the time to take my car to the service station, in fact, I’m writing from there. These guys will take around 4 more hours, so I’m pretty much bored here. But if they think I’m going to leave my car alone, they are very mistaken. I love my car as dearly as Dean loves his ’67 Impala. <em>#SupernaturalReference</em>… Really, you didn’t get that? Never mind. You obviously have better things to do than watch Supernatural. I see you nodding your head, and I raise you <em>bullshit</em>, you’re reading my blog, sir/ma’am. You obviously have more time on your hands than you know what to do with.</p>

<p>So… it’s Sunday, which means I’m back to work tomorrow, writing more articles, spreading information like an epidemic (only, a good one… is there a good one? I wonder…), and well, obviously, foosball.</p>

<p>I’m not even as shabby at foosball as I once was, you know? When I started at the office, which was, 20th of June, 2016, I was so terrible at foosball, I couldn’t even watch myself play. It was painful. I’m getting better, though, so there’s that. Or maybe the others are getting worse. Wow, way to bring myself down. </p>

<h1>What’s Up With My Car</h1>

<p>Turns out, a lot. The poor baby has not been driven this frequently, since it was bought, 11 years back, in 2005. Naturally, she’s not happy about it, but she’ll get serviced, and I’m sure she’s upto the task of driving through the traffic on Ring Road, morning and evening. It’s a 25 km (that’s 15.53 miles, Americans) commute to work, one side, and it takes me 70-90 minutes. Not because I just drive that slow, either. I mean, you can’t drive slow on Ring Road, you’ll get rear-ended (no pun intended (holy crap that rhymed!)). But there’s just so much traffic, I barely cross the 2nd gear on that road. Anyway, the point is, the poor car has had to endure a lot in the last 30 days, and she was due for servicing anyway, so here I am.</p>

<h1>What’s Up With This Place!?</h1>

<p>Like, seriously! This place is hidden behind a labyrinth of roads. The place is in Dwarka, where I live (1km away from Akash Institute… Yes, I’m looking at you, boss! <em>wink</em>), but it doesn’t look remotely like Dwarka. Or maybe it does, and the rest of the sub-city looks nothing like Dwarka… You see? These are the kind of things I think about when I’m <em>this</em> bored! Which is why I prefer to have something to do, almost always; and, almost always, that something to do, is sleep. </p>

<p>Back to this place, though, I’m sitting in the customer lounge, where the AC is set to 28° C, which is only 4° lower than the maximum today. Oh, wait, it’s 29° C. Yeah.</p>

<h1>My Plan For The Rest Of The Day</h1>

<p>Need to talk to a friend who’s in the US. That’s the first thing on my to-do list today. Then we’re probably going to go out for dinner, tonight, or maybe order take-out, whatever. When I was in college, which was until last month, people used to tell me “Oh, you like Pizza now, but once you start working and have to eat Pizza every now and then, you’ll crave for home-cooked meals…” and I’m like… “What makes you think I don’t crave home-cooked food?” I still like Pizza. I’ll always like Pizza. Pizza is the best thing ever. Keep your opinions to yourself.</p>

<p>Why I told you that, was because I’m pretty damn sure if I go out to eat, I’m having Pizza.</p>

<h1>Parting Notes</h1>

<p>Well, this is it. I’m unable to think of anything else of importance (LOL) that I should report to the Emperor. Which reminds me, I need to ask the Emperor why all you stormtroopers, and rebel scum are able to read the Death Star Logs, anyway…</p>

<p>Until next time, then. May the force be with you.</p>
