<h1>Death Star Log 1 | 23 July 2016</h1>

<p>.... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. .-.-.-</p>

<p>For those of you didn’t understand what I’ve written above, it reads “Hello World.” in morse code. You might think me pretentious, and you wouldn’t be completely wrong. However, I actually do love Morse Code.</p>

<p>I’m going to keep the introduction short and sweet, just like I am, except the sweet part. Anyway, this blog will contain weekly (usually) updates from me. These updates will be extremely useful (not), insightful (not) and not at all filled with random crazy shit (it will be).</p>

<p>Honestly, I don’t actually expect anyone to ever read anything that I write on blogs.akshaygangwar.in, partly because I’m not gonna tell people about it, and partly because, well… why would they?</p>

<h1>You’re Still Here?</h1>

<p>Oh ho! I can’t believe you made it through all that. I’m extremely proud of you! Not that it matters, I barely know you. Since you have read this far, I am gonna assume that you have enough time on your hands to read about stuff I will be talking about.</p>

<p>Let’s get this article started, shall we? (Yes, we hadn’t even started, yet…)</p>

<h1>A Day (Week?) in the Life of…</h1>

<p>Before I forget, did I tell you about this super awesome text editor that I’m using these days? It’s called Ulysses and I hope you’ve heard of it. If you haven’t, go check it out right now. It’s awesome, super amazing, minimal and just very very fun to use. Also, it’s paid. But, hey! It’s worth it, at least on the Mac. I have not used the iPhone version, though, and I don’t imagine it being nearly as much fun as it is on the Mac… Maybe on an iPad; but I digress.</p>

<p>It’s <em>finally</em> the weekend. I say <em>finally</em> like I just couldn’t wait, but truth is, I’m having plenty fun at my job, and the days are passing like a breeze. Except the commute: that sucks. Also, it’s <em>finally</em> the weekend; this time I did say <em>finally</em>, because I can sleep as long as I want to!</p>

<h1>Brutally Honest Reviews</h1>

<h6>about some apps I used in the last few days</h6>

<p>So, I work at Beebom. It’s a super awesome website full of crazy cool tech resources. You got a problem? Chances are, Beebom has the solution. I’m not even kidding, we write articles about countless tech related issues, tips and tricks and stuff you didn’t even know you wanted, but you do. <a href="http://beebom.com">Show Us Some Love!</a> </p>

<p>Anyway, working at Beebom means I get to use a shit load of apps, both on my Mac, and on my iPhone. So, a couple of days back, I was about to write an article about some eBook readers for the Mac, so I was reading through articles on Reddit, and going beyond page 1 of the Google search (LIKE WHAATTTT!!? But yeah, really!), and a lot of people had mentioned “Calibre” as being a really great eBook reader for the Mac.</p>

<p>Naturally, I assumed the app must be like the gold standard of the eBook apps available for the Mac, and I was… disappointed.</p>

<p>Actually no, I wasn’t disappointed. I was absolutely horrified. Jesus christ! Calibre is an app that I would never recommend to anyone. The only good thing about the app, and oh dear god, I wanted to find at least one good thing about it, was that it can convert eBooks to different formats. Pretty much an overkill on an eBook “reader”. The UI sucks, the UX sucks because the UI sucks, and the app sucks pretty much because the UI/UX sucks. I actually went and bashed Calibre on the Beebom post that I wrote, later that day, but I’m still so horrified by the thought of that app that I wanted to write about it here as well.</p>

<p>I’m not even being cruel here. I understand that it is difficult to code an app. Heck, I’m a developer myself. The thing is, one thing that Apple definitely makes easy for developers to do, is design the UI of their app. Honestly, Xcode is simply an amazing tool, and I could never have imagined something that looks as bad as Calibre does, to be coded on Xcode. In fact, it’s probably commendable that the developers were able to create a UI <em>that bad</em>; it must take a considerable amount of skill.</p>

<p><strong>I’m so sure I had more apps that I wanted to talk about, but Calibre simply put them all out of my mind…</strong></p>

<h1>Random Stuff a.k.a This Entire Post</h1>

<p>Office is fun, foosball is even more fun, and the people that work at 91 are really amazing folks! The only thing that’s not fun about the weekdays, these days, is driving on the Ring Road. That road! I don’t think that road is ever <em>not</em> congested. Also, all the potholes that <strong>AAP</strong> is <em>”fixing”</em> (they’re not), cause so much trouble that I just… Point is, the condition of the roads is terrible, and worsening by the day.</p>

<p>Apart from that, though, the entire day is super fun.</p>

<h1>Parting Notes</h1>

<p>Look at this, we’re already (or, finally :p), at the end of the post. If you’re still reading, you are either one of my friends that I have been forcing to read my blog, someone who has enough time to kill, or you’re probably just waiting for this post to <em>get to the fucking point</em>. Well, it won’t. I’m actually getting ready to sign off, now, in case the heading didn’t clear that up for you.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you have thoughts about my posts, you can <a href="http://www.akshaygangwar.in/sendemail.html">send me an email</a>, hit me up on twitter, facebook, instagram et al.</p>

<p>If you wish to criticise me, or my posts, you can still send me an email, but you’ll probably not hear back from me, and I will most probably not try to change myself based on it, so it’s pretty much a <em>Moo Point #FRIENDSReference</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ll see you next week, in a new post (hopefully… unless the Rebels figure out that they can easily destroy this entire spaceship by exploiting a single vulnerability in the design. Damn, we really need to fire that architect.)… Until then, adios! </p>
